## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

  The stock market is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by a multitude of factors ranging from global events to company news, economic indicators, and investor sentiment. Predicting stock prices has been a topic of interest for investors, analysts, and researchers for many decades. Accurate predictions can lead to significant financial gains, while inaccurate ones can lead to substantial losses. As such, various mathematical and statistical techniques have been employed to better understand and forecast stock market movements.

This project aims to leverage the power of time series forecasting, specifically using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to predict stock market price trends. ARIMA is a popular method for analyzing and forecasting time series data as it can capture a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data.

## Problem Statement:

Predict the future closing price of a given stock (in this case, the SPY ETF), based on its historical data, using the ARIMA model. The objectives are:

- Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the data.
- Develop a time series forecasting model that can predict future stock prices with reasonable accuracy.
- Evaluate the model's performance against actual stock prices to determine its efficacy and reliability.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset - Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The dataset consists of historical stock prices for the SPY ETF, spanning multiple years. It includes features like opening price, closing price, highest price in the day, lowest price in the day, and trading volume.

Collection: The data was sourced from [YahooFinance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/history?p=SPY)

Dataset Timeline: Jan 28, 1993 - Oct 10, 2023

Dataset Structure: The dataset has 7 columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.
                   There are 7,731 entries, spanning from January 29, 1993, to October 11, 2023.

Missing Values: There are no missing values in any of the columns.

- Initial Data Handling: The process begins by loading the data into a pandas DataFrame, a fundamental step in Python data analysis. This step ensures that the data is in a manipulatable format for further exploration.

- Preliminary Data Assessment: Examining the dataset's summary statistics and checking for missing values. This step is crucial to understand data quality and structure.

## Data Preprocessing

- Data Cleaning and Transformation: The focus here is on preparing the data for analysis. Converting the 'Date' column to a datetime format and setting it as an index is a critical step for time series analysis.

- Feature Engineering: Calculating additional features like daily returns and rolling averages. This step is driven by the need to extract more insights from the data and potentially improve model performance.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visual Analysis: Using plots to visually analyze trends, volatility, and other patterns in the data. This step is key for forming hypotheses about the data.

- Deeper Insights: Conducting autocorrelation analysis. This is particularly important for time series forecasting as it provides insights into how past values of the series are related to its current values.

---

## Advanced EDA

- Statistical Testing for Stationarity: Performing the Dickey-Fuller test to check if the series is stationary, a prerequisite for ARIMA modeling.

- ACF and PACF Analysis: These plots help in identifying the order of the ARIMA model.

---

## Baseline Model Building

- Model Selection and Fitting: Choosing ARIMA(1,1,1) based on insights from the previous steps and fitting it to the data.

- Model Assessment: Evaluating the model through its summary and diagnostic plots. This includes checking the residuals for any patterns or lack thereof, which would indicate model adequacy.

---

## Residual Diagnostics and Model Refinement

- Analyzing Model Residuals: Checking for any systematic structure left in the residuals, which could suggest model inadequacies.

- Iterative Improvement: Applying a log transformation to stabilize variance and refitting the model, followed by re-evaluating the residuals. This iterative approach is key in model development.

---

## Additional Models
- Experimenting with Variations: Exploring the SARIMA model, even in the absence of strong seasonality, is part of a comprehensive approach to model selection.

- Comparing Different Models: This step involves assessing various models to find the best fit for the data.

---

## Model Evaluation Framework

- Forecasting and Validation: Using the log-transformed ARIMA model to forecast future values and presenting these forecasts with confidence intervals. This step is crucial for understanding the model's practical applicability.

- Practical Translation: Converting log predictions back to the original scale to make them interpretable in the real-world context.

## Summary, Key Findings, and Next Steps

- Synthesizing the Work: Summarizing the entire process from data loading to forecasting provides a clear overview of the project's scope and achievements.

- Insights and Learnings: Outlining key findings gives insights into what was learned about the stock price data and the model's capabilities.

- Future Directions: Suggesting next steps like model refinement, advanced models, validation techniques, risk analysis, and deployment strategies shows a forward-thinking approach and an understanding that model development is an iterative and ongoing process.

By following these steps, we continue refining my model's accuracy and reliability, which is crucial in the dynamic environment of the stock market. It's also important to keep abreast of the latest research and methodologies in time series forecasting and financial analysis, as this field is continually evolving.
