## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

  This project aims to leverage the power of time series forecasting, specifically using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to predict stock market price trends. ARIMA is a popular method for analyzing and forecasting time series data as it can capture a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset consists of historical stock prices for the SPY ETF, spanning multiple years. It includes features like opening price, closing price, highest price in the day, lowest price in the day, and trading volume.

Collection: The data was sourced from [YahooFinance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/history?p=SPY)
Dataset Timeline: Jan 28, 1993 - Oct 10, 2023

## Roadmap

Completed:
- Initial data collection and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful information and transform data for the model.

Upcoming:
- Model building using the ARIMA technique.
- Hyperparameter tuning and model validation.
- Forecasting future stock prices and evaluating model performance against actual prices.
- Potentially exploring other models and techniques for comparison.
